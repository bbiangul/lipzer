# Lipzer
Lipzer is a DeFi project to make possible for the community to create buy or sell options (call or put) for cryptoassets, with specif deadline, quantity and prize.

All the options are NFTs that can be stored, transferred and negotiated in the marketplace.

The main smart contracts we already deployed to Binance Smart Chain TestNet:

## 1. Objective 
Lipzer is bringing a concept that already exists in stock markets and it's missing on DeFi Space. 

The options are important for:
* investors who want to protect their assets from the price fluctuations to middle and long-term;
* traders who want to profit leveraged;
* investor who want to buy assets in specific price zones but don't want to lock their money without any revenue;
* traders who wanat to make arbitration operations;
